                a third party in a standard, machine-readable format. If you require the
                direct transfer of data to another responsible party, this will only be
                done to the extent technically feasible.</p>

            <p>This website uses GitHub Pages, a web hosting service provided by
                GitHub, Inc., 88 Colin P Kelly Jr St, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA
                (“GitHub”). GitHub is certified under the EU/US privacy agreement
                „Privacy Shield“ and hence obliged to observe EU privacy regulation.
                GitHub collects and stores information that your browser automatically
                transmits to me in “server log files”. These are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Browser type and browser version</li>
                <li>Operating system used</li>

                <li>Host name of the accessing computer</li>
                <li>Time of the server request</li>
                <li>IP address</li>
            </ul>
            <p>GitHub uses these data to analyse website usage by the visitor, to
                compile reports on the activities of website visitors, and to provide
                further services in connection with the use of the website. Insofar as
                GitHub is bound by law to do so, or if third parties process data on
                behalf on GitHub, data will be transferred to third parties. GitHub will
                not combine visitor data transmitted by the browser with data from other
                sources. For more information on GitHub’s privacy policy, please visit
                <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/github-privacy-statement/">their
                    privacy statement</a>.
            </p>
            <p>The basis for data processing is Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR, which allows
                the processing of data to fulfil a contract or for measures preliminary
                to a contract.</p>
